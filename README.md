### Requirements

- XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP, or any PHP 7.4+ server environment
- MySQL 5.7+ database server
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Download and Extract**:

   - Download the latest release
   - Extract to your web server's document root (e.g., htdocs folder for XAMPP)

2. **Database Setup**:

   - Create a new MySQL database named `uzima_reimbursement`
   - Import the provided `setup_database.sql` file:
     ```
     mysql -u username -p uzima_reimbursement < setup_database.sql
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can use phpMyAdmin to import the SQL file

3. **Configuration**:

   - Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and update with your database credentials
   - If using XAMPP with default settings, the database credentials are typically:
     ```
     DB_HOST=localhost
     DB_NAME=uzima_reimbursement
     DB_USER=root
     DB_PASS=
     ```

4. **File Permissions**:

   - Ensure the `uploads` directory has write permissions
   - On Linux/Mac: `chmod -R 755 uploads`

5. **Web Server Configuration**:

   - For production, ensure HTTPS is enabled
   - Optional: Set up URL rewriting via .htaccess (included)

6. **Test Installation**:
   - Navigate to the application URL in your browser
   - You should see the login page

## Access Credentials

For security in demo environments, here are some guidelines for credentials:

1. **Default Admin Credentials**: For testing purposes only, you can use:

   - Email: admin@example.com
   - Password: Admin123!

2. **Creating Your Own Admin**: After installation, register as a normal user and use the admin promotion script:

   ```
   php update_to_admin.php youremail@example.com
   ```

   Or directly update your user role in the database to "Admin".

3. **Test Users**: You may want to create various test users with different roles (Employee, Manager, Finance Officer) to test the different workflows.

**IMPORTANT**: Always change default credentials in production environments and implement proper security measures.

## Security Recommendations

- Change default credentials immediately
- Use HTTPS in production
- Set up regular database backups
- Update your PHP installation regularly
- Review system audit logs periodically

## Customization

- Company information can be updated in the Admin > System Settings section
- Custom expense categories can be added or modified
- Approval workflows can be customized for different expense types and amounts
- Email templates can be modified in the templates directory

## Troubleshooting

- **Database Connection Issues**: Verify database credentials in .env file
- **Upload Problems**: Check file permissions on uploads directory
- **Email Not Working**: Configure SMTP settings in System Settings
- **Session Expiring Too Quickly**: Adjust SESSION_TIMEOUT in config.php
